# Power users module

Power users module allows to find most valuable users for given Mintbase NFT smart contract

This users might be used as reference for creating look-alikes and other targeting mechanics

Supposed use case:

1. Find list of power users of a target Mintbase NFT smart contract
2. Pass this list to module that will find similar users in the whole network (will be developed as future work)
3. Get the list of potential power users across the whole network
4. Get the list of project with highest number of potential power users
5. Communicate with potential power users directly via airdrops, communication protocols or any other available method (right now communication options are quite limited, but we hope that in nearest future this topic will have number of tools)
6. Communicate with potential power users via co-promotions company with projects from step 4
